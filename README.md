# TerminalChess
A chess program that is done entirely in the terminal. This program will be written entirely in C++.
First the user is asked which side they would like to play for(White or Black). Then, the Computer(when added) or if they choose to play 2-player, will be on the other team. The board will be printed after each move and users can move by specifying which piece they would like to move and what location they would like to move to. If the move is not legal, then it will give the prompt again for a piece and a move. If checkmate is found, the user will be asked if they would like to play again or exit the program.
